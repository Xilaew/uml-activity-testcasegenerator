the goal of this project is to develop a standalone tool to generate teststimuli for unittests from UML Activity diagrams. As input an XMI file containing an UML Model with activity diagrams and OCL expressions needs to be providet. From here an AMPL (www.ampl.com) Model will be generated. With solvers as Gecode, Ilogcp or Coenne these Models can be solved and they will provide the necessary Inputdata. This project aims at supporting reals, integers, sets and nonlinear expressions in ocl.
