\section{Outlook}
Tell about Implementation of Object and Compound Variables and handling of arrays.
Suppose alternative Mathematical Modelling Systems. GAMS, SMT-LIB, GLPK.
\section{Final Conclusion}I build a rudimentary tool which can fully automatically generate boost test code for C and CPP from UML Activities. Up to now it only provides support for Arithmetic and Logical Constraints. Object and Set types can not be supported due to time running out. The chosen approach with a mathematical programming language makes it out of the box suitable for a large variety of Constraints and also extremely large Models when only quadratic Mixed Integer Programming is needed.
