\section{UML}
\label{sec:UML}
The Unified Modelling Language (UML \texttrademark ) is a graphical modelling language defining 13 different diagrams that can be used to describe the architecture, behaviour and interaction of a software systems. Modelling Elements of the UML are defined via the Meta Object Facility (MOF). Any Diagram is internally stored in a Machine readable fashion; this makes it suitable for more than just documentation purpose. With precise modelling a UML Model can also be executed or otherwise automatically analysed. In our case we want to use it to derive necessary test code for C-functions from their corresponding UML Activity Model. \\ We are using only a small subset of the complete UML here for this thesis. The figure \ref{relevantUMLClassDiagram} shows an overview of the most relevant UML modelling elements and their associations in a UML class diagram. We need to understand those elements and their relationships with each other. In the next chapters whenever referring to an element of the UML it will be printed in a special font such as \UMLType{Class}. When we refer to a reference element in UML we will put it into another special font for Example: \UMLReference{ownedOperations}.

\subsection{Structural Modelling Elements}
\subsubsection{Package}
Packages or Namespaces are concepts that are well known to Java or C++ programmers. UML provides \UMLType{Packages} for partitioning large software projects. In the UML specification we read:
\begin{quotation}
A package is used to group elements, and provides a namespace for the grouped elements.
A package is a namespace for its members, and may contain other packages. Only packageable elements can be owned
members of a package. By virtue of being a namespace, a package can import either individual members of other
packages, or all the members of other packages.
In addition a package can be merged with other packages.
\end{quotation}\cite{UML23Superstructure}
\subsubsection{Class}
The concept of classes is also pretty well known from Object Oriented Programming. In the UML specification a class is described as:
\begin{quotation}
A class describes a set of objects that share the same specifications of features, constraints, and semantics.\\
Class is a kind of classifier whose features are attributes and operations. Attributes of a class are represented by instances
of Property that are owned by the class. Some of these attributes may represent the navigable ends of binary associations.
\cite{UML23Superstructure}\end{quotation}
\subsubsection{Operation}
UML Operations are as well pretty much aligned with the wording we are used to from Object Oriented Programming. The specification says:
\begin{quotation}
An operation is a behavioural feature of a classifier that specifies the name, type, parameters, and constraints for invoking
an associated behaviour.\\
An operation is invoked on an instance of the classifier for which the operation is a feature.
\end{quotation}
The associated behaviour of an operation can be an Activity.
\subsubsection{Parameter} 
In programming operations, functions, procedures or methods do very often have a list of arguments or parameters. In UML they are represented by the model element Parameter.
\begin{quotation}
A parameter is a specification of an argument used to pass information into or out of an invocation of a behavioural feature. It has a type, and may have a multiplicity and an optional default value.\\
A parameter specifies how arguments are passed into or out of an invocation of a behavioural feature like an operation. The
type and multiplicity of a parameter restrict what values can be passed, how many, and whether the values are ordered.\\
...
The parameter direction specifies whether its value is passed into, out of, or both into and out of the owning behavioural
feature. A single parameter may be distinguished as a return parameter. If the behavioural feature is an operation, then the
type and multiplicity of this parameter is the same as the type and multiplicity of the operation itself.
\cite{UML23Superstructure}
\end{quotation}
\subsubsection{Constraint}
\label{sec:Constraint}
Constraints and operation contracts are modelled in UML via the modelling element \UMLType{Constraint}.
\begin{quotation}
A constraint is a condition or restriction expressed in natural language text or in a machine readable language for the
purpose of declaring some of the semantics of an element.\cite{UML23Superstructure} Â§ 7.3.10
\end{quotation}
We exclusively consider \UMLType{Constraints} containing a textual OCL expression. How textual OCL expressions are embedded inside of a \UMLType{Constraint} is depending on the tool that is used for editing the model and modelling conventions applied by the modeller. In order not to be to restrictive we will support as many variants as possible.\\ 
The \UMLReference{specification} of a \UMLType{Constraint} can contain a \UMLType{LiteralString} or an \UMLType{OpaqueExpression}. How those Elements can contain textual OCL Expressions will be explained in the next two paragraphs. The OCL Language will be explained in the section \ref{sec:OCL}.
\paragraph{LiteralString}
One way to represent textual OCL in a UML Model is the model element \UMLType{LiteralString}. A \UMLType{LiteralString} contains an arbitrary string in its \UMLReference{value} attribute. Depending on the modelling convention this arbitrary string can be textual OCL.
\paragraph{OpaqueExpression}The more sophisticated way to embed textual OCL is the model element \UMLType{OpaqueExpression}. An \UMLType{OpaqueExpression} has a \UMLReference{body} and a \UMLReference{language} attribute. \UMLReference{Body} and \UMLReference{language} are multi--valued string attributes. It is tool dependent how textual OCL is placed inside an \UMLType{OpaqueExpression}.\\One UML modelling tool for the Eclipse integrated development platform is Papyrus. Papyrus requires the user to put one value into the multi--valued \UMLReference{language} attribute for each value specified for the multi--valued \UMLReference{body}. So when the $n$-th \UMLReference{language} value is "OCL" then the $n$-th \UMLReference{body} will be a textual OCL expression.\\
The commercial tool Artisan Studio\textregistered from Atego\texttrademark will split the user supplied text for a \UMLType{Constraint} after each white-space. Each of those sub--strings separated by white spaces is represented as a \UMLReference{body} value of an \UMLType{OpaqueExpression}. The \UMLReference{language} attribute will be left empty.

% \subsection{Behavioral Modelling}
% \subsubsection{Activities}
% \begin{quotation}
% An activity is the specification of parameterized behavior as the coordinated sequencing of subordinate units whose
% individual elements are actions. There are actions that invoke activities (directly by â€œCallBehaviorAction (from
% BasicActions)â€� on page 250 or indirectly as methods by â€œCallOperationAction (from BasicActions)â€� on page 252).
% Generalizations
%  â€œBehavior (from BasicBehaviors)â€� on page 445
% Description
% An activity specifies the coordination of executions of subordinate behaviors, using a control and data flow model. The
% subordinate behaviors coordinated by these models may be initiated because other behaviors in the model finish
% executing, because objects and data become available, or because events occur external to the flow. The flow of execution
% is modeled as activity nodes connected by activity edges. A node can be the execution of a subordinate behavior, such as
% an arithmetic computation, a call to an operation, or manipulation of object contents. Activity nodes also include flow-of-
% control constructs, such as synchronization, decision, and concurrency control. Activities may form invocation hierarchies
% invoking other activities, ultimately resolving to individual actions. In an object-oriented model, activities are usually
% invoked indirectly as methods bound to operations that are directly invoked.
% Activities may describe procedural computation. In this context, they are the methods corresponding to operations on
% classes. Activities may be applied to organizational modeling for business process engineering and workflow. In this
% context, events often originate from inside the system, such as the finishing of a task, but also from outside the system,
% such as a customer call. Activities can also be used for information system modeling to specify system level processes.
% Activities may contain actions of various kinds:
%  Occurrences of primitive functions, such as arithmetic functions.
%  Invocations of behavior, such as activities.
% â€¢ Communication actions, such as sending of signals.
% â€¢ Manipulations of objects, such as reading or writing attributes or associations.
% 324
% UML Superstructure Specification, v2.3
% Actions have no further decomposition in the activity containing them. However, the execution of a single action may
% induce the execution of many other actions. For example, a call action invokes an operation that is implemented by an
% activity containing actions that execute before the call action completes.
% Most of the constructs in the Activity clause deal with various mechanisms for sequencing the flow of control and data
% among the actions:
% â€¢ Object flows for sequencing data produced by one node that is used by other nodes.
% â€¢ Control flows for sequencing the execution of nodes.
% â€¢ Control nodes to structure control and object flow. These include decisions and merges to model contingency. These
% also include initial and final nodes for starting and ending flows. In IntermediateActivities, they include forks and joins
% for creating and synchronizing concurrent subexecutions.
% â€¢ Activity generalization to replace nodes and edges.
% â€¢ Object nodes to represent objects and data as they flow in and out of invoked behaviors, or to represent collections of
% tokens waiting to move downstream.
% 
% %\textbf{Semantics}
% The semantics of activities is based on token flow. By flow, we mean that the execution of one node affects, and is
% affected by, the execution of other nodes, and such dependencies are represented by edges in the activity diagram. A token
% contains an object, datum, or locus of control, and is present in the activity diagram at a particular node. Each token is
% distinct from any other, even if it contains the same value as another. A node may begin execution when specified
% conditions on its input tokens are satisfied; the conditions depend on the kind of node. When a node begins execution,
% tokens are accepted from some or all of its input edges and a token is placed on the node. When a node completes
% execution, a token is removed from the node and tokens are offered to some or all of its output edges. See later in this sub
% clause for more about how tokens are managed.
% All restrictions on the relative execution order of two or more actions are explicitly constrained by flow relationships. If
% two actions are not directly or indirectly ordered by flow relationships, they may execute concurrently. This does not
% require parallel execution; a specific execution engine may choose to perform the executions sequentially or in parallel, as
% long as any explicit ordering constraints are satisfied. In most cases, there are some flow relationships that constrain
% execution order. Concurrency is supported in IntermediateActivities, but not in BasicActivities.
% Activities can be parameterized, which is a capability inherited from Behavior (see 12.3.9, â€œActivityParameterNode (from
% BasicActivities),â€� on page 345). Functionality inherited from Behavior also supports the use of activities on classifiers
% and as methods for behavioral features. The classifier, if any, is referred to as the context of the activity. At runtime, the
% activity has access to the attributes and operations of its context object and any objects linked to the context object,
% transitively. An activity that is also a method of a behavioral feature has access to the parameters of the behavioral
% feature. In workflow terminology, the scope of information an activity uses is called the process-relevant data.
% Implementations that have access to metadata can define parameters that accept entire activities or other parts of the user
% model.
% 
% An activity with a classifier context, but that is not a method of a behavioral feature, can be invoked after the classifier is
% instantiated. An activity that is a method of a behavioral feature is invoked when the behavioral feature is invoked. The
% Behavior metaclass also provides parameters, which must be compatible with the behavioral feature it is a method of, if
% any. Behavior also supports overriding of activities used as inherited methods. See the Behavior metaclass for more
% information.
% Activities can also be invoked directly by other activities rather than through the call of a behavioral feature that has an
% activity as a method. This functional or monomorphic style of invocation is useful at the stage of development where
% focus is on the activities to be completed and goals to be achieved. Classifiers responsible for each activity can be
% assigned at a later stage by declaring behavioral features on classifiers and assigning activities as methods for these
% features. For example, in business reengineering, an activity flow can be optimized independently of which departments
% or positions are later assigned to handle each step. This is why activities are autonomous when they are not assigned to a
% classifier.
% Regardless of whether an activity is invoked through a behavioral feature or directly, inputs to the invoked activity are
% supplied by an invocation action in the calling activity, which gets its inputs from incoming edges. Likewise an activity
% invoked from another activity produces outputs that are delivered to an invocation action, which passes them onto its
% outgoing edges. See â€œParameter (from CompleteActivities)â€� on page 409 for more about how activities start and stop
% execution.
% An activity execution represents an execution of the activity. An activity execution, as a reflective object, can support
% operations for managing execution, such as starting, stopping, aborting, and so on; attributes, such as how long the
% process has been executing or how much it costs; and links to objects, such as the performer of the execution, who to
% report completion to, or resources being used, and states of execution such as started, suspended, and so on. Used this
% way activity is the modeling basis for the WfProcess interface in the OMG Workflow Management Facility,
% www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/00-05-02. It is expected that profiles will include class libraries with standard classes
% that are used as root classes for activities in the user model. Vendors may define their own libraries, or support user-
% defined features on activity classes.
% Nodes and edges have token flow rules. Nodes control when tokens enter or leave them. Edges have rules about when a
% token may be taken from the source node and moved to the target node. A token traverses an edge when it satisfies the
% rules for target node, edge, and source node all at once. This means a source node can only offer tokens to the outgoing
% edges, rather than force them along the edge, because the tokens may be rejected by the edge or the target node on the
% other side. Multiple tokens offered to an edge at once is the same as if they were offered one at a time. Since multiple
% edges can leave the same node, the same token can be offered to multiple targets. However, a token can only be accepted
% at one target. This means flow semantics is highly distributed and subject to timing issues and race conditions, as is any
% distributed system. There is no specification of the order in which rules are applied on the various nodes and edges in an
% activity. It is the responsibility of the modeler to ensure that timing issues do not affect system goals, or that they are
% eliminated from the model. Execution profiles may tighten the rules to enforce various kinds of execution semantics. Start
% at ActivityEdge and ActivityNode to see the token management rules.
% Tokens cannot â€œrestâ€� at control nodes, such as decisions and merges, waiting to move downstream. Control nodes act as
% traffic switches managing tokens as they make their way between object nodes and actions, which are the nodes where
% tokens can rest for a period of time. Initial nodes are excepted from this rule.
% A data token with no value in is called the null token. It can be passed along and used like any other token. For example,
% an action can output a null token and a downstream decision point can test for it and branch accordingly. Null tokens
% satisfy the type of all object nodes.
% UML Superstructure Specification, v2.3
% 327
% The semantics of activities is specified in terms of these token rules, but only for the purpose of describing the expected
% runtime behavior. Token semantics is not intended to dictate the way activities are implemented, despite the use of the
% term â€œexecution.â€� They only define the sequence and conditions for behaviors to start and stop. Token rules may be
% optimized in particular cases as long as the effect is the same.
% Package IntermediateActivities
% Activities can have multiple tokens flowing in them at any one time, if required. Special nodes called object nodes
% provide and accept objects and data as they flow in and out of invoked behaviors, and may act as buffers, collecting
% tokens as they wait to move downstream.
% Package CompleteActivities
% Each time an activity is invoked, the isSingleExecution attribute indicates whether the same execution of the activity
% handles tokens for all invocations, or a separate execution of the activity is created for each invocation. For example, an
% activity that models a manufacturing plant might have a parameter for an order to fill. Each time the activity is invoked,
% a new order enters the flow. Since there is only one plant, one execution of the activity handles all orders. This applies
% even if the behavior is a method, for example, on each order. If a single execution of the activity is used for all
% invocations, the modeler must consider the interactions between the multiple streams of tokens moving through the nodes
% and edges. Tokens may reach bottlenecks waiting for other tokens ahead of them to move downstream, they may overtake
% each other due to variations in the execution time of invoked behaviors, and most importantly, may abort each other with
% constructs such as activity final.
% If a separate execution of the activity is used for each invocation, tokens from the various invocations do not interact. For
% example, an activity that is the behavior of a classifier, is invoked when the classifier is instantiated, and the modeler will
% usually want a separate execution of the activity for each instance of the classifier. The same is true for modeling methods
% in common programming languages, which have separate stack frames for each method call. A new activity execution for
% each invocation reduces token interaction, but might not eliminate it. For example, an activity may have a loop creating
% tokens to be handled by the rest of the activity, or an unsynchronized flow that is aborted by an activity final. In these
% cases, modelers must consider the same token interaction issues as using a single activity execution for all invocations.
% Also see the effect of non-reentrant behaviors described at Except in CompleteActivities, each invocation of an activity is
% executed separately; tokens from different invocations do not interact.
% Nodes and edges inherited from more general activities can be replaced. See RedefinableElement for more information on
% overriding inherited elements.
% Package IntermediateActivities
% If a single execution of the activity is used for all invocations, the modeler must consider additional interactions between
% tokens. Tokens may reach bottlenecks waiting for tokens ahead of them to move downstream, they may overtake each
% other due to the ordering algorithm used in object node buffers, or due to variations in the execution time of invoked
% behaviors, and most importantly, may abort each other with constructs such as activity final, exception outputs, and
% interruptible regions.
% Package CompleteActivities
% Complete activities add functionality that also increases interaction. For example, streaming outputs create tokens to be
% handled by the rest of the activity. In these cases, modelers must consider the same token interaction issues even when
% using a separate execution of activity execution for all invocations.
% Interruptible activity regions are groups of nodes within which all execution can be terminated if an interruptible activity
% edge is traversed leaving the region.

% \subsubsection{Action}
% \begin{quotation}
% Description
% An action represents a single step within an activity, that is, one that is not further decomposed within the activity. An
% activity represents a behavior that is composed of individual elements that are actions. Note, however, that a call behavior
% action may reference an activity definition, in which case the execution of the call action involves the execution of the
% referenced activity and its actions (similarly for all the invocation actions). An action is therefore simple from the point
% of view of the activity containing it, but may be complex in its effect and not be atomic. As a piece of structure within an
% activity model, it is a single discrete element; as a specification of behavior to be performed, it may invoke referenced
% behavior that is arbitrarily complex. As a consequence, an activity defines a behavior that can be reused in many places,
% whereas an instance of an action is only used once at a particular point in an activity.
% An action may have sets of incoming and outgoing activity edges that specify control flow and data flow from and to
% other nodes. An action will not begin execution until all of its input conditions are satisfied. The completion of the
% execution of an action may enable the execution of a set of successor nodes and actions that take their inputs from the
% outputs of the action.
% Package CompleteActivities
% In CompleteActivities, action is extended to have pre- and postconditions.
% 
% Semantics
% The sequencing of actions are controlled by control edges and object flow edges within activities, which carry control and
% object tokens respectively (see Activity). Alternatively, the sequencing of actions is controlled by structured nodes, or by
% a combination of structured nodes and edges. Except where noted, an action can only begin execution when it has been
% offered control tokens on all incoming control flows and all its input pins have been offered object tokens sufficient for
% their multiplicity. The action begins execution by accepting all the offers of control and object tokens allowed by input
% pin multiplicity. When the execution of an action is complete, it offers control tokens on its outgoing control flows and
% object tokens from its output pins.
% The steps of executing an action with control and object flow are as follows:
% [1] An action execution is created when all its object flow and control flow prerequisites have been satisfied (implicit join).
% Exceptions to this are listed below. The object flow prerequisite is satisfied when all of the input pins are offered all
% necessary tokens, as specified by their minimum multiplicity, and accept them all at once up to their maximum
% multiplicity, precluding them from being consumed by any other actions. This ensures input pins on separate actions
% competing for the same tokens do not accept any the action cannot immediately consume, causing deadlock or starvation
% as actions wait for tokens taken by input pins of other actions but not used.
% [2] When an action accepts the offers for control and object tokens, the tokens are removed from the original sources that
% offered them. If multiple control tokens are available on a single incoming control flow, they are all consumed. Object
% tokens accepted on an incoming object flow to an input pin are placed on the input pin, from which they are consumed by
% the execution of the action. For structured actions, tokens can remain on input pins during action execution, otherwise
% they are immediately removed from the input pins by the action execution.
% [3] An action continues executing until it has completed. Most actions operate only on their inputs. Some give access to a
% wider context, such as variables in the containing structured activity node, or the self object, which is the object owning
% the activity containing the executing action. The detailed semantic of execution an action and definition of completion
% depends on the particular subclass of action.
% [4] When completed, an action execution offers any object tokens that have been placed on its output pins and control tokens
% on all its outgoing control flows (implicit fork), and it terminates. Exceptions to this are listed below. The offered tokens
% may now satisfy the control or object flow prerequisites for other action executions.
% [5] After an action execution has terminated, its resources may be reclaimed by an implementation, but the details of resource
% management are not part of this specification and are properly part of an implementation profile.
% See ValuePin and Parameter for exceptions to rule for starting action execution.
% If an action is not locally reentrant (isLocallyReentrant=false, the default), then no more than one execution of it will
% exist at any given time within the context of a single execution of the containing activity. Even if the action would
% normally begin an execution according to the rules above, it will not start a new execution if there is already one ongoing
% within the same activity execution. In this case, the action simply does not accept any tokens offered to it until its ongoing
% execution has finished. At this point, if the required tokens are still available, the action may accept the offers and begin
% a new execution.
% 
% 
% 
% On the other hand, if an action is locally reentrant (isLocallyReentrant=true), then it will begin a new execution any time
% the rules above allow it, even if there are one or more executions already going within the same activity execution. This
% means that there may be, within any one execution of the containing activity, more than one concurrent execution of the
% action ongoing at any given time.
% A call action for a non-reentrant behavior will also act locally non-reentrant, whatever the value of the isLocallyReentrant
% property for the action. Moreover, an invocation action for a non-reentrant behavior will not execute if there is any
% currently running execution for the behavior, whether invoked by this action or any other (see â€œCallAction (from
% BasicActions)â€� on page 250).
% Package ExtraStructuredActivities
% If an exception occurs during the execution of an action, the execution of the action is abandoned and no regular output
% is generated by this action. If the action has an exception handler, it receives the exception object as a token. If the action
% has no exception handler, the exception propagates to the enclosing node and so on until it is caught by one of them. If an
% exception propagates out of a nested node (action, structured activity node, or activity), all tokens in the nested node are
% terminated. The data describing an exception is represented as an object of any class.
% Package CompleteActivities
% Streaming allows an action execution to take inputs and provide outputs while it is executing. During one execution, the
% action may consume multiple tokens on each streaming input and produce multiple tokens on each streaming output. See
% Parameter.
% Local pre- and post-conditions are constraints that should hold when the execution starts and completes, respectively.
% They hold only at the point in the flow that they are specified, not globally for other invocations of the behavior at other
% places in the flow or on other diagrams. Compare to pre and postconditions on Behavior (in Activities). See semantic
% variations below for their effect on flow.
% \end{quotation}
% 
% \subsubsection{ControllFlow}
% \begin{quotation}
% A control flow is an edge that starts an activity node after the previous one is finished. 
% A control flow is an activity edge that only passes control tokens. Tokens
% offered by the source node are all offered to the target node.
% 
% Semantics
% Activity edges are directed connections, that is, they have a source and a target, along which tokens may flow.
% Other rules for when tokens may be passed along the edge depend on the kind of edge and characteristics of its source
% and target. See the children of ActivityEdge and ActivityNode. The rules may be optimized to a different algorithm as
% long as the effect is the same.
% The guard must evaluate to true for every token that is offered to pass along the edge. Tokens in the intermediate level of
% activities can only pass along the edge individually at different times. See application of guards at DecisionNode.
% Package CompleteActivities
% Any number of tokens can pass along the edge, in groups at one time, or individually at different times. The weight
% attribute dictates the minimum number of tokens that must traverse the edge at the same time. It is a value specification
% evaluated every time a new token becomes available at the source. It must evaluate to a positive LiteralUnlimitedNatural,
% and may be a constant. When the minimum number of tokens are offered, all the tokens at the source are offered to the
% target all at once. The minimum number of tokens must be accepted by the target for any tokens to traverse the edge. The
% guard must evaluate to true for each token. If the guard fails for any of the tokens, and this reduces the number of tokens
% that can be offered to the target to less than the weight, then all the tokens fail to be offered. An unlimited weight means
% that all the tokens at the source must be accepted by the target for any of them to traverse the edge. This can be combined
% with a join to take all of the tokens at the source when certain conditions hold (see examples in Figure 12.45). A weaker
% but simpler alternative to weight is grouping information into larger objects so that a single token carries all necessary
% data (see additional functionality for guards at DecisionNode).
% Other rules for when tokens may be passed along the edge depend on the kind of edge and characteristics of its source
% and target. See the children of ActivityEdge and ActivityNode. The rules may be optimized to a different algorithm as
% long as the effect is the same. For example, if the target is an object node that has reached its upper bound, no token can
% be passed. The implementation can omit unnecessary weight evaluations until the downstream object node can accept
% tokens.
% Edges can be named, by inheritance from RedefinableElement, which is a NamedElement. However, edges are not
% required to have unique names within an activity. The fact that Activity is a Namespace, inherited through Behavior, does
% not affect this, because the containment of edges is through ownedElement, the general ownership metaassociation for
% Element that does not imply unique names, rather than ownedMember.
% UML Superstructure Specification, v2.3
% 335
% Edges inherited from more general activities can be replaced. See RedefinableElement for more information on overriding
% inherited elements.

% \subsubsection{ActivityFinalNode}
% \begin{quotation}
% An activity final node is a final node that stops all flows in an activity.
% An activity may have more than one activity final node. The first one reached stops all flows in the activity.
% 
% A token reaching an activity final node terminates the activity (or structured node, see â€œStructuredActivityNode (from
% CompleteStructuredActivities, StructuredActivities)â€� on page 423). In particular, it stops all executing actions in the
% activity, and destroys all tokens in object nodes, except in the output activity parameter nodes. Terminating the execution
% of synchronous invocation actions also terminates whatever behaviors they are waiting on for return. Any behaviors
% invoked asynchronously by the activity are not affected. All tokens offered on the incoming edges are accepted. The
% content of output activity parameter nodes are passed out of the containing activity, using the null token for object nodes
% that have nothing in them. If there is more than one final node in an activity, the first one reached terminates the activity,
% including the flow going towards the other activity final.
% 
% \end{quotation}
% \subsubsection{InitialNode}
% \begin{quotation}
% An initial node is a control node at which flow starts when the activity is invoked.
% 
% Semantics
% An initial node is a starting point for executing an activity (or structured node, see â€œStructuredActivityNode (from
% CompleteStructuredActivities, StructuredActivities)â€� on page 423). A control token is placed at the initial node when the
% activity starts, but not in initial nodes in structured nodes contained by the activity. Tokens in an initial node are offered
% to all outgoing edges. If an activity has more than one initial node, then invoking the activity starts multiple flows, one at
% each initial node. For convenience, initial nodes are an exception to the rule that control nodes cannot hold tokens if they
% are blocked from moving downstream, for example, by guards (see Activity). This is equivalent to interposing a
% CentralBufferNode between the initial node and its outgoing edges.
% Note that flows can also start at other nodes, see ActivityParameterNode and AcceptEventAction, so initial nodes are not
